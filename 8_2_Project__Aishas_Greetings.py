# You are a part of Aisha's Greetings - a card printing company that prints greetings
# cards with a hint of personalization! You want to help Aisha create a system that
# generates cards based on customer's requests.
#
# You have been provided with two pre-filled card types:
#
# - happy_bday.txt: a card with a birthday message
#
# - thankyou_card.txt: a card file with a thank you message
#
# Click through the files on your right and see what's in them! If you get stuck,
# you can look at a sample solution of the project by looking at greetings_solutions.py
# - but try it out on your own first.
#
# Let's start printing!
